### Overview
<br>
Minimal bias data in particle detectors amounts to the background data the detector receives when not online, i.e. receiving the intended beam of particles.  This data is mostly noise, but not entirely.  We want to implement unsupervised training on a CVN like, previously explored, architecture.  The purpose of this project is to see if unsupervised networks could be used in the search for new physics.

<br>
We first intend to check to see that the network, once built, can differentiate noise from previously expected physics in the minimal bias data.  Then, we want to let it explore the data more freely and check to see its findings.  Searching for anomalies in data has been the steadfast focus of experimental high energy physics since its beginning in the early 20th century, so taking that tradition to the next state of the art is not only something we're keen on doing, but something which is important for the field as a whole.
